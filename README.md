## About

The goal of this project is to build an [Artificial Neural Network (ANN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset. By building an ANN from the ground up, we'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, back-propagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. We'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

This project was developed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) program.
